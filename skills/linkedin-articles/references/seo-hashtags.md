# LinkedIn Article SEO & Discoverability

## How LinkedIn surfaces articles

LinkedIn articles are indexed by both LinkedIn's internal search and Google. Unlike regular posts, articles have a public URL and can rank in Google search results for up to months after publishing. This makes keyword placement more important than for regular posts.

## Keyword strategy

### Where to place keywords

1. **Title** — Most important. Include the primary keyword naturally.
2. **First paragraph** — LinkedIn's crawler and Google both weight this heavily.
3. **Subheadings** — Use secondary keywords in H2/H3 headers where natural.
4. **Throughout body** — Aim for natural density, not stuffing.

### Keyword selection

- Use the exact terms your target audience searches for, not jargon or euphemisms
- Prefer specific phrases over broad terms ("B2B SaaS churn reduction" > "customer retention")
- Think about what someone would type into Google or LinkedIn search to find this article

### Title SEO tips

- Lead with the keyword, not a filler word ("Remote Team Management" not "A Guide to Managing Remote Teams")
- Include the year for time-sensitive topics ("2025 State of...")
- Questions as titles can rank for featured snippets in Google

## Hashtag strategy

### How many hashtags

Use **3 to 5 hashtags**. More than 5 dilutes reach and looks spammy; fewer than 3 misses distribution opportunities.

### Hashtag mix formula

| Type | Example | Typical followers |
|---|---|---|
| Broad / umbrella | #Leadership, #Marketing, #Technology | 1M+ |
| Mid-tier niche | #ProductManagement, #SaaSGrowth | 100K-1M |
| Specific / long-tail | #RemoteTeamManagement, #B2BContentMarketing | <100K |

Use 1 broad + 1-2 mid-tier + 1-2 specific. The specific hashtags reach a more targeted audience; the broad ones add volume.

### Hashtag placement

Place hashtags at the **end of the article**, separated from the body with a line break or "---". Do not scatter hashtags through the article text (that's a regular post pattern, not articles).

### Hashtag research

To find the right hashtags:
1. Search the topic on LinkedIn — note what hashtags appear in top articles
2. Visit linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/[keyword] to see follower counts
3. Check competitor articles in the niche

### Hashtag capitalization

Use CamelCase for multi-word hashtags: `#ContentMarketing` not `#contentmarketing`. LinkedIn search is case-insensitive but CamelCase is easier to read.

## Publishing timing

LinkedIn article reach is highest when published:
- **Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday**
- **7-9 AM or 12-1 PM** in the audience's primary time zone

Avoid weekends and Monday mornings. Articles get indexed regardless of publish time but early engagement signals boost algorithmic distribution.

## Boosting discoverability after publishing

1. **Share as a regular post** — Paste the article URL in a regular LinkedIn post with a hook summarizing the key insight. This is the primary driver of article views.
2. **Comment early** — Respond to every comment in the first hour; this boosts the article in commenters' networks.
3. **Tag 1-2 people** (sparingly) who are directly relevant — not mass tagging.
4. **Cross-post** — Share the LinkedIn article URL in newsletters, Slack communities, or Twitter with a brief teaser.

## Internal linking

If you have multiple articles on related topics, link between them. LinkedIn does not heavily reward internal linking, but it increases time-on-profile and helps readers explore your content.

## Article vs. post: when to use articles

| Use an article when | Use a post when |
|---|---|
| Content is 400+ words | Short-form (under 300 words) |
| You want Google indexing | Conversational or reactive |
| How-to or structured guide | Personal story or quick insight |
| Building an evergreen resource | Timely or trending topic |
| You want a permanent public URL | Engagement in the next 24-48 hours matters most |
