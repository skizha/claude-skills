# Hooks & Headlines for LinkedIn Articles

## The hook's job

LinkedIn shows only the first ~2 lines before "...see more". The hook must make the reader tap that link. A good hook creates one of: curiosity, stakes, a surprising claim, or immediate recognition ("that's me").

## 8 hook formulas

### 1. The Uncomfortable Truth
State something true that people don't want to admit.

> "Most people don't fail because they lack talent. They fail because they optimize for the wrong thing."

> "Your onboarding process is losing you customers. And you have the data to prove it — you're just not looking."

### 2. The Specific Contrarian
Disagree with a popular belief. Be specific, not vague.

> "7 years of hiring experience, and I've stopped looking at resumes entirely. Here's why."

> "Everyone says to post every day on LinkedIn. I post twice a week and grew 30,000 followers. The math doesn't work the way you think."

### 3. The High-Stakes Story Opening
Drop into a moment of tension. No setup.

> "I gave the board my resignation at 9 AM. By 10 AM, they'd countered with an offer I didn't expect."

> "We were 48 hours from running out of runway. What happened next changed how I think about leadership."

### 4. The Numbered Promise
Commit to a specific, concrete payoff.

> "5 things I wish I knew before my first leadership role. (Number 3 cost me a team.)"

> "I've reviewed 500+ portfolios this year. These 4 things separate the ones who get interviews from the ones who don't."

### 5. The Direct Question
Ask something the target reader is already asking themselves.

> "Why do some teams stay calm under pressure while others fall apart?"

> "What separates the people who get promoted from the people who deserve to?"

### 6. The Counter-Intuitive Insight
Lead with the surprising conclusion, then let the article prove it.

> "The best thing you can do for your productivity is work less."

> "The companies beating everyone on retention aren't paying more. They're doing something simpler."

### 7. The Credibility + Claim
Use a specific credential to earn authority, then make a bold claim.

> "After 12 years in product management at companies from Series A to Fortune 500, I've noticed one pattern that predicts failure every time."

> "I've interviewed 300+ engineers. The ones who get offers all do one thing differently in the first 5 minutes."

### 8. The Relatable Observation
Name a feeling or experience your audience has but hasn't articulated.

> "There's a particular kind of exhaustion that comes from doing work that doesn't matter. You know exactly what I mean."

> "Nobody tells you that getting promoted can feel worse than being passed over. Until it happens to you."

## Headline formulas

Titles appear in LinkedIn search results and when the article is shared. Make them specific and scannable.

| Formula | Example |
|---|---|
| Number + Adjective + Topic | "7 Hard Lessons from Building a Remote Team" |
| How to [Result] Without [Common Cost] | "How to Give Feedback That Lands Without Burning Bridges" |
| What [Group] Gets Wrong About [Topic] | "What New Managers Get Wrong About Delegation" |
| The [X]-Minute [Topic] Framework | "The 10-Minute Weekly Review That Changed How I Work" |
| Why [Belief] Is Costing You [Result] | "Why Hustle Culture Is Costing You Your Best People" |
| [Number] Things I Learned From [Experience] | "5 Things I Learned From Getting Laid Off Twice" |
| The Truth About [Topic] Nobody Tells You | "The Truth About Startup Culture Nobody Tells You" |

**Headline tips**
- Include a number when possible — specificity builds trust
- Avoid clickbait that the article can't pay off
- 6-10 words is the sweet spot for shareability
- Front-load the most important word (not "A" or "The")
- Test two versions mentally: which one would you click?

## Hook mistakes to avoid

- **Starting with "I"**: LinkedIn feeds deprioritize posts starting with "I". Start with the observation or claim.
- **Starting with context-setting**: "In this article, I'll discuss..." — reader closes tab immediately
- **Burying the lead**: Don't make readers wade through background to find the interesting part
- **Vague promises**: "I have some thoughts on leadership" gives no reason to keep reading
- **Overused openers**: "In today's fast-paced world...", "I'm excited to share...", "Game changer!"
