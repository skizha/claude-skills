# LinkedIn Article Structure & Formatting

## Length targets

| Goal | Word count |
|---|---|
| Thought leadership / opinion | 800-1,200 words |
| How-to / tutorial | 1,200-2,000 words |
| Story-driven / personal | 600-1,000 words |
| Industry analysis | 1,500-2,500 words |

LinkedIn's algorithm slightly favors articles that keep readers on-page 3+ minutes (~700-900 words at average reading speed). Longer is only better if every section earns its place.

## Structure templates

### 1. Problem-Solution (best for authority/thought leadership)
```
Hook: Expose a painful problem the audience recognizes
Why it happens: Root cause (1-2 paragraphs)
The solution: Your framework or insight
Evidence: Example, data, or story
Takeaway: Actionable summary
CTA
```

### 2. Listicle (best for engagement and shares)
```
Hook: Promise a specific number of insights
Intro: Why this list matters (1 short paragraph)
[N] items, each with:
  - Bold subheading
  - 2-4 sentence explanation
  - Optional micro-example
CTA
```
Keep lists to 5-10 items. Odd numbers perform slightly better (5, 7, 9).

### 3. Story-Driven (best for personal brand)
```
Hook: Start in the middle of the action (in medias res)
The struggle: What went wrong or what was at stake
The turning point: Insight or decision
The outcome: What changed
The lesson: Generalized takeaway for the reader
CTA
```

### 4. How-To / Tutorial (best for practical value)
```
Hook: State the outcome the reader will achieve
Why this matters: Brief context
Prerequisites: What they need before starting (optional)
Step 1 through N: Each step gets its own subheading
Common mistakes: 1-2 pitfalls to avoid
Summary
CTA
```

### 5. Contrarian Take (best for virality)
```
Hook: State the conventional wisdom
Reframe: "Here's why that's wrong" or "Here's what people miss"
Evidence: Data, examples, or logic supporting your reframe
Nuance: Acknowledge when the conventional wisdom is right
New mental model: Give readers something to take away
CTA
```

## Formatting rules

**Paragraphs**
- 1-3 sentences per paragraph — never more
- One idea per paragraph
- Add a blank line between every paragraph

**Subheadings**
- Use bold or H2/H3 headers every 200-300 words
- Make them scannable — the article should be understandable from subheadings alone
- Avoid generic headings like "Introduction" or "Conclusion"

**Lists**
- Use bullet lists for 3+ parallel items
- Keep bullets to 1-2 lines each
- Don't nest bullets

**Emphasis**
- Bold key phrases, not entire sentences
- Italics for titles, technical terms, or gentle emphasis
- Avoid ALL CAPS

**Opening paragraph**
- Never start with "In today's world" or "I'm excited to share"
- The hook IS the first paragraph — no preamble
- LinkedIn truncates the preview at ~2 lines; make them count

**Closing / CTA**
Choose one CTA type:
- Question: "What's your take? Drop it in the comments."
- Follow prompt: "Follow me for weekly insights on [topic]."
- Resource: "I wrote a free guide on this — link in comments."
- Reflection: End on a thought that lingers; no explicit ask needed for pure thought leadership

**Images**
- Header image strongly recommended (increases click-through from feed)
- 1-2 inline images max for long articles
- Alt text helps accessibility and SEO
