# LinkedIn Articles Skill

## Workflow

### Writing from scratch

1. Clarify: topic, target audience, and goal (educate / inspire / generate leads / build authority)
2. Choose a structure from `references/article-structure.md`
3. Write a hook using patterns in `references/hooks-patterns.md`
4. Draft the body following the chosen structure
5. Close with a strong CTA (question to comments, follow prompt, or link)
6. Apply SEO and hashtags from `references/seo-hashtags.md`

### Optimizing an existing draft

1. Assess the draft against the checklist below
2. Rewrite the hook if it doesn't create immediate curiosity or tension
3. Tighten structure: break walls of text, add subheadings every 200-300 words
4. Sharpen the CTA
5. Apply SEO improvements

**Quick optimization checklist**
- [ ] Hook creates curiosity or stakes in the first 2 sentences
- [ ] Title uses a power word or specific number
- [ ] Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences max
- [ ] Subheadings every 200-300 words
- [ ] One clear CTA at the end
- [ ] 3-5 relevant hashtags
- [ ] Keywords appear in title + first paragraph

## Reference files
