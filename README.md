Based on Anthropic's official prompt engineering docs. |
| sql-server-query-tuner | [sql-server-query-tuner](skills/sql-server-query-tuner) | SQL Server query performance tuning — analyzes execution plans, identifies anti-patterns, recommends indexes, rewrites slow queries, and runs DMV diagnostics against live instances. |

## Installation

### From the marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add skizha/agent-skills
/plugin install humanize@skizha-skills
```

The skills will be available in your next Claude Code session. Invoke them with `/humanize` or by asking Claude to humanize text, or trigger the SQL tuner by asking Claude to tune a query.

### Local testing

Load the repo directly as a plugin directory:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/agent-skills
```

## Usage

Skills trigger automatically based on your prompt. For example:

**Humanize** — activates when you say things like:
- "humanize this text"
- "make this sound less robotic"
- "remove AI writing patterns from this file"

You can also invoke it directly with `/humanize`.

**Prompt Creator** — activates when you say things like:
- "write a prompt for a customer service chatbot"
- "create a system prompt that outputs JSON"
- "improve this prompt — it keeps hallucinating"
- "help me prompt engineer a RAG pipeline"
- "why isn't my prompt working?"
- "make a few-shot prompt for sentiment classification"

Covers all major techniques: role/persona, few-shot, chain-of-thought, prompt chaining, structured output, RAG, agentic prompts, and meta-prompting. Includes Claude-specific best practices (XML tags, extended thinking, long context ordering) and a diagnostics guide for fixing underperforming prompts. Based on official docs from Anthropic, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, and OpenAI.

**SQL Server Query Tuner** — activates when you say things like:
- "tune this query"
- "why is this SQL slow"
- "check my database for missing indexes"
- "analyze this execution plan"
- "optimize this SQL Server query"

Supports both pasting queries/execution plans for analysis and running DMV diagnostics against a live SQL Server instance.

**LinkedIn Articles** — activates when you say things like:
- "write a LinkedIn article about [topic]"
- "optimize my LinkedIn article"
- "write a hook for my article"
- "add hashtags to this article"
- "improve my article structure"

Includes 5 article structure templates (Problem-Solution, Listicle, Story-Driven, How-To, Contrarian), 8 hook formulas with examples, headline patterns, SEO keyword placement guidance, and a hashtag strategy (broad/mid/niche mix). Delivers ready-to-paste output with hashtags.
